```[p]cog list trusty```
	You will see qposts listed.
```[p]pipinstall  bs4```
	This is required for qposts to work.
```[p]cog install trusty qposts```
	This Installs it.
```[p]load qposts```
	This Loads the qposts cog
```[p]dlq```
	This has the qposts sync with 8Chan all the posts that are there. If you do this after you add it to a text channel, it will spam that channel with tons of qposts, and not in order.
```[p]qchannel {Channel}```
